# Jet Lag Radio
Whether you're on the air or offline, it will get to you eventually

# Overview
This is a collection of whatever material I can get about [Jet Set Radio Live](https://jetsetradio.live) with the main goal being preservation and helping people find songs.

Currently, here's the resources I have:
- **Dump of each stations** (https://archive.org/details/JSRL-station-08312020)
  - For offline listening.  Because of how slow Archive.org is for uploading it's hard to constantly maintain.
- **M3U files for online streaming**
  - Streams the mp3 file directly from the site for each station. Currently doesn't have song length information.
-**Direct Download Links for each station** (.csv)
  - For people who only want to download certain songs~~ Files are inaccessible, only good if you wanted to see the names.
- **Custom cover art for each station**
  - Most of the mp3 files don't have any metadata, so I made some album covers using the wallpaper background for each station.
- **Plain text and CSV listing of each song and artist**
  

# Issues
I don't know how often the site gets updated so some songs may be added, removed, or changed later on in the future.  It's also dependant on the site staying online and that nothing changes with the page's source code that would break my current method of grabbing these songs (though it may not be hard to figure out).

The program I used to quickly get all this information was something I slapped together in Java using my limited programming knowledge, it's currently a mess and probably won't be useful to most people.

Also I should mention that "Jet Mash Radio" is whack due to using Russian characters in it's file name which is then used as the song's URL so it ends up not encoding well.
